# RandomSequence

## About

This project offers an API for random number generation and some implementations that use it.

## License

[This API is licensed under a GNU general public license.](./LICENSE "LICENSE")

## Usage

All methods are defined based on `nextUniformLong()`, so this API can be implemented by simply implementing that method.

## Methods

This API includes methods to get and set the state of a generator, generate each type of value with different distributions and parameters, pick elements from collections and shuffle them.

Distributions include:
* Uniform distribution
* Bates distribution
* Normal distribution
* Lognormal distribution
* Triangular distribution
* Pareto distribution
* Weibull distribution
* Exponential distribution
* Gamma distribution
* Beta distribution
* Poisson distribution
